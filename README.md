## Near - CoreNFC Example App

#### Requirements

* iOS 11 beta 
* iPhone 7 or 7 Plus

The app will build and run in the simulator but will do nothing interesting. Tapping scan in the Simulator or on an unsupported device will yield an error alert.


#### Overview

This project is a sample app showing how to use CoreNFC with NDEF tags or hardware. It was tested with a limited number of NDEF tags. 

From the main screen, tapping scan will show the system UI for NFC scanning. Hold the tag or device near the top of the phone. A scan result will appear. You can drill down into the message and see individual message records.
